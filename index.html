                    <p>An unsecured loans customer is everyone. That’s right.<br><br> Loans without collateral are used by everyone, all of the time. These loans are used to purchase that new item you may have had your eye on. They could be used for an unexpected
                        expense in which you need extra funds to help you through. Loans Now understands that each individual is just that, an individual. Individuals have unique needs and lifestyles. That is why Loans Now states that we have the “right product
                        for your lifestyle.”
                        <br><br> We often hear the question, “what is an unsecured loan?” Unsecured loans are just that, unsecured. What does unsecured mean? Unsecured means that you are offering no collateral. Collateral is usually in the form of a vehicle,
                        investment product or real estate. <br><br>Personal unsecured loans are made to individuals, not companies. They are the same as personal installment loans and cover a wide variety of individuals and situations. These individuals may
                        need bad credit, fair credit, or good credit personal loans. These are not title or payday loans. Personal loans are fixed loans for a certain time period. This time period is usually either 2, 3, 5 or 7 years.</p>

                    <p>Loans Now has been in business since 2013. It was created to assist individuals in obtaining hard to find bad credit loan through our unique Loan Discovery Process. After years in the financial services industry, it was becoming obvious
                        that lending sources were becoming scarce – and even more troublesome was the fact that lending guidelines were becoming even more strict. <br><br>Given these new challenges, Loans Now saw the need for a platform which could assist
                        clients like you by compiling the best possible loan products available into one space. That space was Unsecured Personal Loans Now.<br><br> One of the best aspects of Loans Now is the fact that we service all credit types to include
                        credit cards, loans for bad credit and personal installment loans. We have sought out the best programs and have included the longest repayment terms available so that our clients have the best opportunity to obtain the loans that
                        they are seeking. Loans Now adheres to several standards. In no way does Loans Now ever collect information which would compromise the identity or security of our clients. Loans Now never charges a fee for any product or service. Loans
                        Now never shares any information with 3rd parties, so our clients never receive harassing phone calls or emails. Even more exciting is that Loans Now works with our partners to offer bad credit loans We review credit scores down to
                        450.

                    that information. We do recommend using our ‘know your score’ link to identify your current credit score prior to starting the process, or any loan process for that matter. This helps our clients to receive a no credit check loan.

                    than choose from various lending products available once they’ve responded to the questionnaire on the Loans Now website.
                    <br><br> Our Loan Discovery approach not only improves our client success rates, but it helps our clients avoid having their credit pulled multiple times as they seek the ideal loan solution. Our goal is to provide honest, transparent
                    information that helps our clients get the unsecured personal loan that’s right for them.</p>
